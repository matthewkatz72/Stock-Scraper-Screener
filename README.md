# Stock-Scraper-Screener
Quick Selenium Python project for scraping specific stock info from various websites


I started this project because I had a difficult time finding a good dashboard that represnted stock data in a way I wanted to see it.
I decided to create my own scraper to pull specific data from specific sites.
I then would use a google sheet with conditional formatting and data filtering to represent that data in a visual way that could be interpreted at a glance.

The goal of the project was to see if I could find specific variables related to stocks, that by tracking, I could trade off of to make money.
